Problem Statement:-
Your app consists of a form that contains 3 input tags and 2 select tags inside a form (this is already in the template provided)
Details of the Form:-
Product Name:- Input Tag(Type Text)
Product Category:- Select Tag
Brand:- Input Tag(Text)
Price:- Input Tag(Type Number)
Delivered By:- Select Tag
We have an h1 tag with initial text Total Price:- 0
We will also have a Table with the following Rows:-
Product Name
Category
Brand
Price
Delivered By
Price Segment
Delete

When you submit the form The data from the form should be appended in the Table as a Row.Screenshot 2022-07-06 at 11.54.28 AM.png
The Value in the Price Segment column does not come from the form. If the price is Greater than 1000 the text should be Expensive else the text should be Not-Expensive
When you click on Delete that particular row should be deleted.
If any of the input fields are empty the data should not be added and show an alert with the below message:- Fill all input fields
The h1 tag should always show the total price of all the products according to the items in row.
Note:
Focus more on the functionality of your app. Avoid spending more time on styling. You can do that once you finish the end-to-end flow of the app. All the best!
